we did the project in VS2017

The software has been created using windows forms application using Visual Studio 2017 integrated with MySqp Database. The Graphic User Interface of the application has been developed using C# and the tables and constraints have been implemented using MySql. Around 22 different forms were used to build this application and each one has a separate code.

The restaurant management software aims to solve some of the problems faced by the regular restaurants that use the paper based ordering system. The application allows the customers to view the menu and send their order directly to the chef. This reduces the chances of an error and also saves a lot of time. The application also allows the waiter to check the status of the tables â€“ whether they are occupied, or need to be cleared. To reduce the wastage of time, the customers will also be given an option to pay for the food directly from the application using an external online payment portal. The application allows the customers to give feedback. Therefore the restaurant can make use of the software to increase its efficiency, make the display more appealing, and carry out the traditional tasks with minimal effort and errors.
